I chose to consider potential problems from the field of number theory, partly due to my own interest from various competition problems and partly because such problems can be fairly easy to describe and still be explored at varying degrees of complexity. I'd come across Diophantine equations before, and since I was curious about their methods of solution, I decided to focus my Extended Essay on this area of number theory. I ultimately chose the rational cuboid problem as I found it unique in that it had a geometrical representation. I am currently trying to find an example of an Euler brick myself using properties of Pythagorean triples and researching techniques in number theory such as modular arithmetic. I also hope to
